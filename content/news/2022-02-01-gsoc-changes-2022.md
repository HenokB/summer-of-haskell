Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is a global, online program focused on bringing new
contributors to open-source software development. GSoC Contributors work with an
open-source organization on a 12+ week programming project under the guidance of
mentors.  As in previous years, Haskell.org will be applying to join this
program as open-source organization.  However, some changes have been made!

# Who can join

In 2022, the program will be addressed to all newcomers of open source that are
18 years and older. GSoC will no longer be solely focused on university students
or recent graduates - people that are at various stages of their career, recent
career changers, self-taught, those returning to the workforce, etc., are
welcome to join. Those changes should better fulfill the needs of open source
communities and provide more flexibility to both projects and contributors.

# Time frames

Organizers are aware that not everyone can devote an entire summer to
coding. Offered projects are available in multiple sizes: medium (~175 hours)
and large (~350 hours). There's an availability to join a 12-week program or
extend the deadline - up to 22 weeks.

# Projects ideas submissions

Are you working on a Haskell project, and you could use the help of a student
during the summer? Consider contributing it as an idea here! Send a pull request
to our [github repository](https://github.com/haskell-org/summer-of-haskell)
([example from 2020](https://github.com/haskell-org/summer-of-haskell/blob/ba41af89efe18a2383163e80156cc900e443e461/content/ideas/stylish-haskell-ghc-lib-parser.md)).

# TL;DR

GSoC 2022: OSS projects, developed during Summer (from June to
September/November) for newcomers that are 18 years and older and want to spend
175 - 350 hours on coding activities, with a mentor's support.
