title: 'Haskell.org GSoC results for 2021'
author: 'Jasper Van der Jeugt'

[Google Summer of Code] made some changes this year: projects were effectively
part-time projects.  This means that the projects had to be somewhat smaller in
scope.  We only received 10 slots from Google this year; which is fewer than
last year.

Despite that, all our 10 slots were successful!  This is the first that has
happened in the history of [Haskell.org]'s participation in the program.
Some of these are high-profile and will benefit a lot of users in the ecosystem,
which is super exciting.

1.  **Enhanced figure support in pandoc**  
    Student: Aner Lucero  
    Mentors: tarleb  
    [Student report](https://argent0.github.io/posts/2021/pandoc-gsoc.html)

    > Google summer of code was a great way to expand my involvement with the
    > haskell community and to test my knowledge working on one of haskell's
    > most used apps.

2.  **Gradually Typed Hasktorch**  
    Student: Julius Marozas  
    Mentors: Torsten Scholak  
    [Student report](https://gist.github.com/jul1u5/7c5fadb51a9c5f8d7f2a722d6071c1da)

3.  **Dhall bindings to TOML configuration language**  
    Student: Marcos Lerones  
    Mentors: Gabriella Gonzalez, Simon Jakobi  
    [Student report](https://dev.to/marcosjlr/google-summer-of-code-summary-dhall-bindings-to-csv-4g0f)

4.  **Haskell in CodeMirror 6**  
    Student: Olivian Cretu  
    Mentors: Chris Smith  
    [Student repo](https://github.com/odc19/haskell_code_mirror)

5.  **Fixing ihaskell-widgets**  
    Student: David DavÃ³  
    Mentors: James Brock, Vaibhav Sagar  
    [Student report](https://gsoc21.ddavo.me/)

    > Three years ago, I started learning Haskell and functional programming. As
    > I had recently started using Jupyter Notebooks in other projects, I wanted
    > to try using them with Haskell to take notes and do the course homework. A
    > few weeks in, I noticed I couldn't use the widgets, but I didn't give it
    > much thought. Three years later, this summer, I've had the opportunity to
    > fix it, while learning a lot in the process.
    >
    > That's what open source is about.

6.  **TidalCycles API and editor plugin**  
    Student: Martin Gius  
    Mentors: Alex McLean  
    [Student report](https://github.com/polymorphicengine/tidal-gui/blob/main/README.md)

7.  **Haskell Language Server: Symbol Renaming**  
    Student: Oliver Madine  
    Mentors: Pepeiborra  
    [Student report](https://gist.github.com/OliverMadine/96927f88b6e5e7890e5179559089166c)

    > Working on the Haskell Language Server (HLS) was my first time using
    > Haskell in production. While navigating through different areas of the
    > tooling infrastructure, the community was supportive in helping me develop
    > my understanding.
    >
    > Specifically, my project involved exploring hie-bios and the GHC API to
    > create a symbol renaming plugin. Overall, the work was engaging, and I was
    > able to substantially improve my development skills with the help of my
    > mentor!

8.  **Support call hierarchy in Haskell Language Server**  
    Student: Lei Zhu  
    Mentors: Javier Neira, Pepeiborra  
    [Student report](https://github.com/July541/GSoC-2021)

    > Haskell community is warm and friendly to everyone, no matter you are
    > a beginner or an expert. This summer, I am more familiar with
    > haskell-language-server and GHC itself. Thank haskell.org and GSoC
    > for providing this opportunity!

9.  **Visualization Libraries for ghc-debug**  
    Student: Ethan Tsz Hang Kiang  
    Mentors: Matthew Pickering  
    [Student report](https://zyklotomic.github.io/blog/gsoc_2021_final_eval.html)

10. **TOML Support in dhall-haskell**  
    Student: Julio Grillo  
    Mentors: Gabriella Gonzalez, Simon Jakobi  
    [Student report](https://gist.github.com/ear7h/78265c4755adc01fa6e6a19e3307ef4d)

We hope that Google hosts the program in 2022; and in that case we plan to apply
again.  If you have ideas for projects that students could work on, we'll be
using the same format as the years before -- [this page](/ideas.html) has more
information on how to submit an idea.

Thanks a lot to everyone involved!
